## Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead use GitHub [built-in capabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to report a security 
vulnerability privately.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help me better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version is supported.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English.
